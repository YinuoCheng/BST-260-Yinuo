
## Introduction
This project utilizes the R programming language for data reading, processing, analysis, and visualization. We will employ several popular R packages to accomplish these tasks.

## Environment Requirements
- R programming language environment
- RStudio or other R editors (optional)

## Installing R Packages
Run the following commands in the R console to install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("patchwork")
Loading R Packages
In your R script, use the  function to load the necessary R packages. Here is the code to load these packages:library()

r
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
Running the R Script
Save the following code as an  file, for example, .
Open the file in RStudio or your R editor.
Click the "Run" button or use the shortcut key (usually Ctrl + Enter) to execute the script..Rdata_analysis.R
